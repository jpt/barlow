# Barlow

Barlow is a slightly rounded, straight-sided highway type family designed by [Jeremy Tribby](https://tribby.com). Drawing from the visual style of the California public, Barlow shares qualities with the state's car plates, highway signs, busses, and trains.

The family includes 54 styles in three widths and nine weights, as well as italics, suitable for large and small digital and print use. Customizable weights and widths were formerly available via a "GX" file; a new VF is being produced. 

Barlow is named after internet pioneer, EFF co-founder, songwriter, and activist [John Perry Barlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow), in tribute to his lasting [impact on the information superhighway](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence). Please consider making a donation to the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org/donate) in his memory.
